**Resort Analysis**
This project involves a detailed analysis of resort data using Python and Microsoft PowerBI to derive insights and make data-driven recommendations.

**Overview**
This analysis was conducted with two primary tools:

Python: For data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Microsoft PowerBI: For creating advanced visualizations based on the processed data.

**Data Loading and Preparation:**
Loaded the dataset and performed initial cleaning, including renaming columns and handling missing data.
Managed memory usage efficiently to handle large datasets.
Feature Engineering:

Created additional features from existing data to enhance the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted in-depth analysis using Python, uncovering key trends and insights.
Used visualizations to explore relationships and distributions within the data.
Data Visualization with PowerBI:

Exported the cleaned and engineered dataset to Microsoft PowerBI.
Developed interactive dashboards to visualize the findings effectively.

**Technologies Used**
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Microsoft PowerBI: For interactive data visualization
